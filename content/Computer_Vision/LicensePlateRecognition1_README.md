**Short Description:**  
Detects and extracts license plate numbers from vehicle images using Tesseract OCR and contour detection. Includes preprocessing steps, but OCR accuracy is inconsistent across image types.

# License Plate Recognition using Tesseract OCR

This project detects and extracts license plate numbers from vehicle images using classical computer vision techniques and Tesseract OCR.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects license plate from full car image using contour detection.
- Applies image preprocessing: edge detection, filtering, thresholding.
- Extracts alphanumeric license text using Tesseract OCR.
- Works with `.jpg`, `.png`, and uploaded images in Google Colab.
- Plots the detected plate image and prints the extracted number.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tesseract-OCR
- Matplotlib
- pytesseract
- Google Colab (for easy file uploads)

Install required packages:

```bash
!pip install pytesseract opencv-python-headless matplotlib
!apt install tesseract-ocr
```

## üìÇ How it works

1. **Load and preprocess the image**  
   - Convert image to grayscale.  
   - Apply bilateral filtering to remove noise while preserving edges.  
   - Use Canny edge detection to highlight edges.

2. **Detect contours and find license plate region**  
   - Identify contours in the edged image.  
   - Approximate each contour to a polygon.  
   - Select the contour with four sides (likely a license plate).  
   - Extract (crop) the plate region from the image.

3. **Enhance cropped plate for OCR**  
   - Resize the cropped region to enlarge text.  
   - Apply Gaussian blur and adaptive thresholding to clean up the image.

4. **Apply Tesseract OCR**  
   - Use `pytesseract.image_to_string()` to extract text.  
   - Tune `--psm` (Page Segmentation Mode) for better results (e.g., `psm 6` or `8`).  
   - Filter the output to keep only alphanumeric characters.

5. **Display the final result**  
   - Show the detected plate image.  
   - Print the extracted license plate number.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

‚ùå Inconsistent OCR accuracy on blurry, angled, or poorly lit images.  
‚ùå Fails when license plates have state logos, fancy fonts, or small characters.  
‚ùå Misreads common characters (O vs 0, I vs 1, etc.).  
‚ùå Not suitable for real-time or highly reliable applications.
