A deep learning-based face mask detection system using MobileNetV2, trained on a Kaggle dataset. The model classifies images into "Mask" and "Non Mask" and can be tested with webcam or custom uploads.

# Face Mask Detection using MobileNetV2

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using transfer learning with MobileNetV2. It classifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not from an image, webcam feed, or uploaded photo.
